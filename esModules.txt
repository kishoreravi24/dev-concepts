Concept of es modules:
before es modules, we all are used to write javascript files and import it in html files with script tag
but in comes of debugging it is very difficult to solve this in es5 we have require , while this solves the debugging at 70% rate but in comes of larges js file and more to add on it is difficult so to solve this , webpack comes in we can build or bundle up the js scripts in to one file and we can use it, that time the speed and control of the js files in the application is so good , but config those js files from webpack are so confused, and again to solve this issue parcel comes in major it includes webpack solution and the solution for config, so the parcel is so quick and we have the config control also but in large scale applications, parcel not performed well to solve this vite comes in so vite is like having both webpack and parcel, so to say bundle all the modules/components in one build and work with it.
and with vite there is term called HMR (hot module replacement) with this it can update the sepcific module and build the specific module not all the modules for a change, so the work is so good at it.
